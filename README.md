# osb-cassandra
Service Broker for Cassandra Deployments

## Tests

Osb-cassandra holds an Unit and Integration Test mix. With the help of an embedded cassandra during test runs, the results of the queries can be investigated without needing a preinstalled and configured cassandra instance running. The essential service specific stages of the osb-spec are coverted (provisioning, binding, unbinding and deprovisioning).
